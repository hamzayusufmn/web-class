the main difference i noticed between vue.js and express is how much express works in the backround
to ensure our code works. for example, using post and patch in HTTTPI and developer tools allowed use to test everything
ane ensure everything was smooth. vue.js was more frontend in terms of visual items and working along as code was still being written.

express also was the main framework we connected to azure and was more online based as it involed using our local host and uploading to azure. we could use
sql database to see our data and httpi to ensure our post and patch worked and served as a visual guide to ensure our code was working .

a key component we used in vue.js was data binding and this allowed for v-on call and changes to ask users questions.
the vue.app handled in a manner where we can enter data and adjust our data in the app. api requests were used to ensure to get the questions and alsp deal
with webpage crashes like a user entering the wrong data, and giving error codes to issue that users might encounter.
